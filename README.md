# Java-Password-Generator

This Java program calculates the total number of valid 8-character passwords based on custom rules and generates a random password that follows those rules. The first character of the password must be a digit (0–9), and the remaining seven characters can be a mix of digits, lowercase letters (a–z), and special characters (*, &, $, #). The total number of possible combinations is also computed using combinatorics with Math.pow().
